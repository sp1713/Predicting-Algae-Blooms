Predicting when does the algae blossoms
algaeDataset is our Dataset name
```{r}
library(DMwR)
algaeDataset <- algae
```

From the below summary we can observe that during the winter season maximum water samples has been taken, also from the chemical parameters summary we undertand that we have some NA's value
```{r}
summary(algaeDataset)
```

Removing the NA from the dataset

```{r}
algaeDataset <- na.omit(algaeDataset)
```
#Visualizing the algae blossoms
From this histogram we come to know that during winter season maximum PH is been recorded

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(algaeDataset,aes(mxPH,fill = season)) + geom_histogram(colour = "black")
```

As we can see from the boxplot, we have a lot of outliers thus concluding that these values must have a lot of effect on the orthophoshate chemical count of the river

```{r}
boxplot(algaeDataset$oPO4, ylab="Orthophosphate Count")
```

As we can see from the below graph that maximum times when the size of the river is medium we have taken the samples to identify the algae blossoms 

```{r}
ggplot(algaeDataset,aes(x=size)) + geom_bar(colour = "Red")
```

Here we are doing a bivariate boxplot which is helping us to understand about algae 1 that in what kind of the size of the river does it blossom more, so here we say that when the river size is small algae 1 blossoms a lot and we also see lot of outliers river size is medium 

```{r}
library(lattice)
bwplot(size~a1,data=algaeDataset,xlab = "Algae A1",ylab = "River size")
bwplot(season~a1,data=algaeDataset,xlab = "Algae A1",ylab = "Season")
bwplot(speed~a1,data=algaeDataset,xlab = "Algae A1",ylab = "River speed")
```

#Multivariate Normal distribution check:

Here we have calculated covriance and column Means for the normal distribution check
```{r}
colnames(algaeDataset)
x <- dist(scale(algaeDataset[, c("mxPH", "mnO2", "Cl","NO3","NH4","oPO4","PO4","Chla")],
center = FALSE))
as.dist(round(as.matrix(x), 2)[1:12, 1:12])
x <- algaeDataset[, c("mxPH", "mnO2", "Cl","NO3","NH4","oPO4","PO4","Chla")]
cm <- colMeans(x)
S <- cov(x)
d <- apply(x, MARGIN = 1, function(x)t(x - cm) %*% solve(S) %*% (x - cm))
d
S
cm ##from the column means we can say that mxPH,mnO2,NO3 and Chla are related because the column means are close enough
```

##Now let us draw the normal Q-Q plot for all the chemicals observed in the river

For PH level we are having a symmetric distribution with flat tails
MNo2 - negatively skewed
Cl - positively skewed
No3 - positively skewed
NH4 - symmetric with flat tails on the right
OPo4 - positive skewed
Po4 - symmetric with flat tails
CHla - negatively skewed with lot of outliers
```{r}
{qqnorm(algaeDataset[,"mxPH"], main = "PH level") 
  qqline(algaeDataset[,"mxPH"])}

{qqnorm(algaeDataset[,"mnO2"], main = "MnO2 level") 
  qqline(algaeDataset[,"mnO2"])}

{qqnorm(algaeDataset[,"Cl"], main = "Cl level") 
  qqline(algaeDataset[,"Cl"])}


{qqnorm(algaeDataset[,"NO3"], main = "NO3 level") 
  qqline(algaeDataset[,"NO3"])}

{qqnorm(algaeDataset[,"NH4"], main = "NH4 level") 
  qqline(algaeDataset[,"NH4"])}

{qqnorm(algaeDataset[,"oPO4"], main = "oPO4 level") 
  qqline(algaeDataset[,"oPO4"])}

{qqnorm(algaeDataset[,"PO4"], main = "PO4 level") 
  qqline(algaeDataset[,"PO4"])}

{qqnorm(algaeDataset[,"Chla"], main = "Chla level") 
  qqline(algaeDataset[,"Chla"])}

{plot(qchisq((1:nrow(x) - 1/2) / nrow(x), df = 8), sort(d),
     xlab = expression(paste(chi[3]^2, " Quantile")),
     ylab = "Ordered distances")
abline(a = 0, b = 1)} ##symmetric distribution with flat tail on the right

```

#t-test statics are applied on based of the season on 7 different types of algae

Now we will perform t-test statistics for the season and the frequencies of the algae
```{r}
with(data=algaeDataset,t.test(a1[season=="winter"],a1[season=="spring"],var.equal=TRUE)) ## with this we say that yes there is a lot of algaes 1 blossmings during winter and spring

with(data=algaeDataset,t.test(a1[season=="summer"],a1[season=="autumn"],var.equal=TRUE)) ## with this we say that yes there is a lot of algaes 1 blossmings during summer and autumn too

with(data=algaeDataset,t.test(a2[season=="winter"],a2[season=="spring"],var.equal=TRUE)) ##alage 2 also we can see the same amount of blossoms

with(data=algaeDataset,t.test(a3[season=="winter"],a3[season=="spring"],var.equal=TRUE)) ## alage 3 also we can see the same amount of blossoms

with(data=algaeDataset,t.test(a4[season=="winter"],a4[season=="spring"],var.equal=TRUE)) ## alage 4 also we can see the same amount of blossoms

with(data=algaeDataset,t.test(a5[season=="winter"],a5[season=="spring"],var.equal=TRUE)) ## alage 5 also we can see the same amount of blossoms

with(data=algaeDataset,t.test(a6[season=="winter"],a6[season=="spring"],var.equal=TRUE)) ## alage 6 also we can see the same amount of blossoms

with(data=algaeDataset,t.test(a7[season=="winter"],a7[season=="spring"],var.equal=TRUE)) ## alage 7 also we can see the same amount of blossoms

```

#Hotelling T2 test:

For all the algaes all the hotelling test were significant except for algae 6 where we are getting the NA value
```{r}
library(Hotelling)
t2testalgae <- hotelling.test(mxPH + mnO2 + Cl + NO3 +NH4 + oPO4 + PO4 + Chla ~ a1, data=algaeDataset)
cat("T2 statistic =",t2testalgae$stat[[1]],"\n")
print(t2testalgae)

t2testalgae2 <- hotelling.test(mxPH + mnO2 + Cl + NO3 +NH4 + oPO4 + PO4 + Chla ~ a2, data=algaeDataset)
cat("T2 statistic =",t2testalgae2$stat[[1]],"\n")
print(t2testalgae2)

t2testalgae3 <- hotelling.test(mxPH + mnO2 + Cl + NO3 +NH4 + oPO4 + PO4 + Chla ~ a3, data=algaeDataset)
cat("T2 statistic =",t2testalgae3$stat[[1]],"\n")
print(t2testalgae3)

t2testalgae4 <- hotelling.test(mxPH + mnO2 + Cl + NO3 +NH4 + oPO4 + PO4 + Chla ~ a4, data=algaeDataset)
cat("T2 statistic =",t2testalgae4$stat[[1]],"\n")
print(t2testalgae4)

t2testalgae5 <- hotelling.test(mxPH + mnO2 + Cl + NO3 +NH4 + oPO4 + PO4 + Chla ~ a5, data=algaeDataset)
cat("T2 statistic =",t2testalgae5$stat[[1]],"\n")
print(t2testalgae5)

t2testalgae6 <- hotelling.test(mxPH + mnO2 + Cl + NO3 +NH4 + oPO4 + PO4 + Chla ~ a6, data=algaeDataset)
cat("T2 statistic =",t2testalgae6$stat[[1]],"\n")
print(t2testalgae6)

t2testalgae7 <- hotelling.test(mxPH + mnO2 + Cl + NO3 +NH4 + oPO4 + PO4 + Chla ~ a7, data=algaeDataset)
cat("T2 statistic =",t2testalgae7$stat[[1]],"\n")
print(t2testalgae7)
