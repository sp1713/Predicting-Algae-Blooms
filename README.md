# Predicting-Algae-Blooms
High concentrations of certain harmful algae in rivers constitute a serious ecological problem with a strong impact not only on river lifeforms, but also on water quality. Being able to monitor and perform an early forecast of algae blooms is essential to improving the quality of rivers.
With our analysis we want to predict the factors that are responsible for the algae to bloom which will help in improving the quality of water and save the various river lifeforms.
The river samples were taken across different European regions.
DATASET VARIABLES:
1)	Season: There are 4 seasons namely; Autumn, spring, summer and winter.
2)	Speed of the river
3)	Size of the river
4)	mxPH: This shows the maximum PH value of the river.
5)	mnO2: Minimum value of O2(oxygen) in the river.
6)	Cl: Mean value of Chloride.
7)	NO3: Mean value of Nitrates.
8)	NH4: Mean value of ammonium.
9)	oPO4: Mean value of orthophosphate.
10)	PO4: Mean value of phosphate.
11)	Chla: Mean of chlorophyll.
12)	"a1"
13)	"a2"
14)	"a3"
15)	"a4"
16)	"a5"
17)	"a6"
18)	"a7"
QUESTION WE WANT TO ADDRESS:
1)	Our first primary question is to answer which river characteristics or chemical compositions lead to each type of algae to bloom. So there will be a different combination for all 7 types of algae.
2)	Conditions when the algae aren’t blooming at all (Combination of Variables).
3)	Conditions when the algae are blooming in a large number(Combination of Variables).
4)	Conditions when the algae aren’t blooming at all (Individual Variable).
5)	Conditions when the algae are blooming in a large number(Individual Variable).
6)	Which factor contributes on the highest level for the algae blooms.
7)	Which factor contributes the least for the algae to bloom
8)	Each River characteristics
9)	Each chemical characteristics.
